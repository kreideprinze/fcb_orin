"""RC channels that are switches rather than knobs.

The zoom knob is continuously variable and belongs to rc_source; these are
the channels that pick something instead of setting a level -- a momentary
button, and a rotary or toggle with a few detented positions.

Both are edge-triggered on purpose. RC channels report a *level*, tens of
times a second, for as long as the pilot holds the switch where it is.
Acting on that level directly would fire a momentary button hundreds of
times per press, and would make a mode switch re-assert its position
continuously -- which means it would win every arbitration against any
other commander, forever, and no keyboard or script could ever set the
mode while the switch sat where it was. Reporting only transitions makes
the switch behave the way the pilot expects: it acts when they move it,
and otherwise leaves the mode alone.

Stale RC is treated as "no information", never as a release or a change.
A transmitter that browns out mid-flight must not be able to fire a button
press or a mode change on the way back up.
