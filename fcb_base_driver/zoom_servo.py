"""Closed-loop zoom control over VISCA, on its own thread.

Zoom is driven as a closed loop rather than by firing absolute-position
commands. VISCA gives a command two sockets; an absolute CAM_Zoom Direct
holds its socket until the lens physically arrives, so streaming Direct
commands from a continuously-moving RC knob exhausts the sockets within a
second and the camera starts refusing them with "command buffer full".
Variable-speed drive commands (CAM_Zoom Tele/Wide) complete immediately,
so this polls the zoom position, compares it against the requested target,
and drives towards it at a speed proportional to the error -- stopping
inside a deadband. That tracks a moving knob smoothly and never backs up
the command buffer.

Polling backs off once the lens is holding its target. The VISCA link and
the video stream share one USB3 connection on the NeoHD board, and there
is no reason to keep asking a stationary lens where it is at 20 Hz.

Two commanders are arbitrated: the RC knob, and whatever asks for a target
by hand. Any manual request takes over until control is handed back, since
the RC knob would otherwise immediately win -- it is always publishing.

#:
#: The coast is the whole problem this servo has to solve. Even at the
#: slowest speed the lens travels 25 counts after being told to stop, and
#: at full speed 402. A servo that stops when it is "close enough" and then
#: measures again therefore always finds itself past the target, drives
#: back, overshoots again, and hunts forever -- which is exactly what a
#: parked knob used to do. So the stop is issued *early*, by the distance
#: the lens is about to cover anyway.

#: A position inquiry is a serial round-trip at 9600 baud, measured at
#: ~60 ms. The position acted on is therefore always that stale, and at

RESUME_BAND = 250

#: How square on the target the lens has to be before the servo calls it
#: done, and how many slow trims it may spend getting there. The coast
#: model is good but not exact -- the lens does not travel at quite the
#: same rate everywhere in its range -- so a first approach can land half
#: a detent out. A trim fixes that.
#:
#: The count is the whole safety argument. An unbounded "correct until
#: close" is precisely the hunting this replaced; a bounded one improves
#: the landing and then, right or wrong, stops.
