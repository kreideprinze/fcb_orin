"""One MAVLink connection serving both RC channels and vehicle telemetry.

Everything that needs the flight controller shares this: the zoom knob on
an RC channel, the recording switch on another, and the position/attitude
stream the flight recorder writes alongside each video frame. It is one
class because it must be one connection -- two processes (or two objects)
opening the same serial port would interleave reads and corrupt both.

ArduPilot sends almost nothing to a companion link unless asked, so the
streams are requested on connect and re-requested after a reconnect.

Every reading is stamped with the monotonic time it arrived. Telemetry is
sampled asynchronously and far slower than 60 fps video -- GPS lands at a
few hertz -- so a consumer pairing telemetry with a video frame needs to
know how stale each value is rather than assuming it is frame-accurate.
