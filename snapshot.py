"""Getting a look at what the camera sees, without a video link.

The drone has no downlink for video. The only channel back to the ground
station is the SSH session the recorder is already running in, and that is
a link you are also flying on -- filling it with a stream would cost
telemetry latency for a picture nobody is watching most of the time.

So the picture is sent on demand, once per button press, in two forms:

  - a JPEG written on the drone, downscaled but real, which is there to
    pull off later or right now if you want the detail;
  - a coarse colour rendering printed straight into the tmux pane, which
    is what actually crosses the link. It costs tens of kilobytes once,
    tells you where the camera is pointed and roughly what is in frame,
    and needs nothing installed on the ground station -- the terminal that
    is already open draws it.

The rendering uses the upper-half-block character with a foreground and a
background colour, so one character cell carries two pixels and the image
comes out with square pixels at the aspect ratio the camera shot it at.

#: a dim scene the noise alone is enough to make almost every cell differ
#: from its neighbour and re-emit. Measured on a frame off the drone at
